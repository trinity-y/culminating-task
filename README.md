# culminating-task

game for my culminating (ISC201). it's supposed to be zelda themed.

### how to install
1. download using the 'clone or download' button (*instructions are if you download as .zip*)
2. extract
3. place contents into a folder if they're not already
4. run main.py

*note: you need to install pygame before running.*

### playing
click the '?' on the intro scene for instructions.
your objective is to kill the sorcer at the top of your screen. 
by killing the small enemies, you heal yourself (for a maximum for 400 health), 
harm the enemy (a small amount), and gain money.

you can use money to upgrade your sword (and hopefully soon to purchase
health potions and possibly projectiles).
